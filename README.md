# blockchain-a-z

This repository holds python implementations of a blockchain, a cryptocurrency and a smart contract. All are of the general purpose nature. The contents follow the course [Blockchain A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/build-your-blockchain-az/) by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves in Udemy. 

The contents for the implementation of the general purpose Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Smart Contract are under in ``notebooks/``. The Smart Contracts build on top of Cryptocurrency intuition, which itself builds on the concepts of the Blockchain.

The implementations have been done with Jupyter Notebooks. This is to enable viewing the development process and the finished partial general purpose projects directly in this repository without the need to fork. For the Blockchain and the Cryptocurrency there is an Python implementation. For the Smart Contract the implementation is composition of Ethereum tools.
