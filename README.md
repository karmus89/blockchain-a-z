# blockchain-a-z

This repository holds python implementations of a blockchain, a cryptocurrency and a smart contract. All are of the general purpose nature. The contents follow the course [Blockchain A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/build-your-blockchain-az/) by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves in Udemy. 

The implementations will be done using Jupyter Notebooks. This is to enable viewing the development process and the finished partial general purpose projects directly in this repository without the need to fork. The contents will be in their respective folders.
